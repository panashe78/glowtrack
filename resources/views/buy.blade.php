                    As a first time buyer with us, simply fill in a registration form, with your personal detail, and company details should you be buying for a company. For your convenience this can be done online by clicking Here*. After paying your deposit you will be issued with a buyer's card, which then allows you to participate in the auction. Be sure to take note of the Terms and Conditions of Sale* .  
                    Once the auction starts, the auctioneer will call out bids. If the item and price are favourable, raise your card and continue to do so until you are either unhappy with the price or you are the only bidder left. Should you be the only bidder left, the auctioneer will then indicate that you have won and the item is now yours subject to final payment.  
                    Should you not be able to attend the auction in person, you have the option to fill in a Proxy Bid*  form or, on certain auctions request to participate via Telephone Bid* . Both options will require you to register as you would if you were attending the auction in person but allows you the freedom to be elsewhere at the time of the auction.
